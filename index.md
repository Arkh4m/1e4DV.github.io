I am a husband, a father and a technologist. Nothing is more important than family. My wife is a deadset legend; funny, smart and drop-dead gorgeous. My son is an incredibly sharp, happy and chilled little dude.

I am employed as the Director of Innovation for [atmail](https://www.atmail.com) – a global software company headquartered at Peregian Beach. Our white label email platform empowers Telcos and service providers and provides an exceptionally integrated, personalised and secure email experience for over 170 million users in more than 90 countries.

My core responsibility is to fully realise the revenue potential, and savings, offered by ideas.

My other responsibilities include the implementation and maintenance of innovation strategies, processes and workflows; to foster external innovation networks to quickly deliver new and exciting products to market; to define and deliver roadmaps for each product; to own the complete customer digital experience with our products; to be the ‘Voice of the Market’ for the company; and to support, guide and mentor team members.

As a father, and as a technologist who is raising a family on the Sunshine Coast, I am invested in the growth of a sustainable innovation ecosystem in the region and enabling job creation. As a senior leader within a technology company, I want to do all I can to help attract talent to the area. As an innovator and product manager, I love helping ideas evolve into new products, services and business models.

I have an insatiable appetite for apps relating to communication (email, messaging and encryption), health tracking (fitness, sleep and nutrition) and productivity (in particular, the applications of natural language processing to enhance user experience and efficiency). I am deeply interested in the impact technological advances have on identity and privacy; and I am fascinated by wearable tech.

I am a staunch advocate of an individual’s right to privacy, equality and freedom of choice. These are fundamental human rights.

I have many interests, but I truly love playing chess, reading, growing bonsai and lifting weights. I’m also into photography, obstacle racing, playing the guitar and motorsport.

Finally, I am grateful to live and work in paradise; on the [Sunshine Coast](https://www.visitsunshinecoast.com/) in Queensland, Australia.
